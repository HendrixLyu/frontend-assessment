Hi,

This is Hendrix and my Email is lyuhanchi@gmail.com.

I didn't use any framework like React or Vue for this exercise, just a simple web page layoutï¼Œand only exercise-2 used vanillaJS, so it can be viewed through go-live on localhost.
Both exercises 1 and 2 made a responsive layout and set breakpoints. Exercise 1 is limited by the size of the image, so the best experience is >992px (for desktop) and < 768px (for mobile).
Exercise 2 only sets a breakpoint at 768px. I'm rewriting Exercise 2 in React, and I'll push it later.
The current version is already working.

For the last Question, here is my answer (also shown in baNaNa.png):
 + 'a' = NaN
'b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a' = 'baNaNa'
('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase = 'banana'
